## 🌌 Core Features

- **Hybrid Story Intel**: Use local models via Ollama for maximum privacy, or connect to cloud vendors (OpenAI/Anthropic) for advanced analysis.
- **Visual World Graph**: A dynamic network graph that maps connections between characters, locations, and events.
- **Privacy-First**: Your creative work stays on your machine. We use a local-first architecture to ensure your stories are yours alone.
- **Intelligent Organization**: Manage series bibles, chapter timelines, and entity metadata in a unified environment.

## 📜 Our Philosophy: Free Forever Community

We believe every writer should have access to professional-grade tools.
- The **Community Version** of Novellis includes all core story-building features and will remain **free forever** for individuals.
- Advanced features (large-scale consistency checking, deep analysis, and novel scope AI research) will be available in the **Preview/Professional** editions.
