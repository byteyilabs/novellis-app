Novellis is built on a fundamental shift in how creative writing software functions. Instead of a simple text editor with a sidebar, it is a **narrative intelligence engine** designed to understand your world as deeply as you do.

## 1. Intelligence Architecture

The "brain" of Novellis consists of three interconnected layers:

- **The Series Bible (Knowledge Base)**: A structured repository of your characters, locations, items, and lore.
- **The Storyline (Causal Graph)**: A non-linear map of arcs and events that defines *what* happens and *why*.
- **The Manuscript (Draft)**: The actual prose where your world comes to life.

Unlike traditional tools, these layers are bi-directionally linked and **evolve organically**. You don't need to define your entire world upfront; as you draft your manuscript, the Intelligence Engine identifies new entities and arcs, suggesting updates to your Series Bible and Storyline.

## 2. Local-First Lore

Your creativity belongs to you. Novellis operates on a **local-first** philosophy:
- **Zero-Cloud Storage**: Your project files, lore, and drafts never leave your machine.
- **Bring Your Own AI**: You connect to your own LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models via Ollama), ensuring you have full control over data privacy and costs.
- **Offline Intelligence**: With local models, you can write and brainstorm without an internet connection.

## 3. Narrative-Centric Design

Novellis encourages you to think in **Arcs** and **Events**. 
- An **Arc** is a sequence of related events (e.g., "The Hero's Journey" or "The Mystery of the Missing Artifact").
- An **Event** is a specific moment in time occurring in a Chapter, involving specific Entities.

By focusing on these building blocks, the software can provide high-level analysis of pacing, character presence, and plot consistency. Critically, this structure **grows with your novel**. The more you write, the more "intelligence" the system gathers, refining its analysis of your world's internal logic in real-time.
