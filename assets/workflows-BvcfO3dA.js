const e=`# Core Workflows

Novellis is designed to adapt to your creative process. Whether you are a "plotter" who plans everything or a "pantser" who writes by the seat of your pants, the system grows alongside your manuscript.

## 1. Initializing (Optional)
While you can start by building a **Series Bible**, you don't have to. You can jump straight into drafting, and the AI will help you extract lore as it emerges.
- **Define Entities**: Create profiles for characters or locations as you think of them.
- **Organic Lore**: Use the AI Copilot to formally capture details from your prose into the Bible.

## 2. Planning with the Narrative Matrix
Use the **ArcView** to map out your story before (or while) drafting.
- **Create Arcs**: Define the main plot and subplots.
- **Sequence Events**: Place events into chapters to see how your arcs overlap.
- **Apply Lenses**: Use the "Entity Filter" to see the story strictly from one character's perspective, helping you identify plot holes or missing motivations.

## 3. Drafting with the Writing Copilot
The AI Copilot is your tireless creative partner.
- **Set Context Scope**: Switch between "Chapter" (for focused drafting) and "Novel" (for global consistency checks).
- **Referential Brainstorming**: Ask questions like *"What would [Character Name] do in this situation?"* and the AI will reference their Series Bible entry.
- **Explore Citations**: When the AI suggests a plot point, use the "Reference Sidebar" to see exactly which parts of your lore it used to reach that conclusion.

## 4. Analysis & Evolution
As your manuscript grows, Novellis provides increasingly deep insights.
- **Context Graph**: Visualize how your chat history connects to your evolving world.
- **Dynamic Analysis**: The system re-analyzes your causal graph and consistency every time you add a new chapter or event.
