Narrative Intelligence is the superpower of Novellis. It transforms your project from a document into a structured narrative database that **adapts as you write**.

## The ArcView & Narrative Matrix
The primary interface for this intelligence is the **ArcView**. It provides a "God view" of your story's structure.

### 1. The Matrix (Gantt Perspective)
Visualize your story arcs as horizontal tracks across your chapters.
- **Pacing Analysis**: See where your story is "crowded" with too many arcs and where it might be dragging.
- **POV Lenses**: Filter the matrix to see only the chapters where a specific character appears, ensuring their journey is consistent and well-paced.

### 2. Arc Builder
The AI can assist in building these structures:
- **Auto-Discovery**: Let the AI analyze your draft to identify subplots you might have started subconsciously.
- **Temporal Alignment**: Ensure that events in different arcs aren't happening at contradictory times.

### 3. Event Drill-Down
Click any event in the matrix to see:
- A detailed description of the event.
- The entities involved.
- The specific chapter where it occurs.
- A direct link to jump into the editor at that exact moment.

## Why it matters
Traditional outlining is rigid and static. Narrative Intelligence is fluid and **adaptive**. It doesn't require a finished plan; it provides precision based on whatever content is available, allowing your structure to evolve naturally as your story comes to life.
