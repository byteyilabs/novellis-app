const e=`# AI Model Safety & Trust

Trust is the foundation of Novellis. We provide tools that ensure your intellectual property is protected and that your AI interactions are secure.

## 1. No Training on Your Data
When you connect to established providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, we utilize their API platforms. 
- **Zero Retention**: We configure our API calls to opt-out of data training by default where the provider allows.
- **Direct Connection**: Your API keys are stored locally on your machine and are only used for direct communication with the model provider.

## 2. Local Models (Ollama)
For absolute certainty, we recommend using **Ollama** or other local inference engines.
- **completely Air-Gapped**: You can run Novellis and your AI model entirely offline.
- **No Third-Party Access**: Your lore and drafts never touch any server, including ours.

## 3. Transparency
Novellis provides a **Heads-Up Display (HUD)** for all AI interactions:
- **Token Usage**: See exactly how much each request costs.
- **Context Awareness**: Know exactly which files were sent to the AI for each prompt.
- **Audit Logs**: Review past AI interactions to see what was discussed and what data was referenced.

## 4. Your IP remains Yours
The content generated by AI in Novellis is your property. We do not claim any rights to your manuscripts or world-building notes.
