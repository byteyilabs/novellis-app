const e=`# World Graph

The World Graph is a visual representation of your story's lore. It turns abstract notes into a tangible, navigable network of characters, locations, and artifacts.

## Visualizing Connections
Storytelling is about relationships. The World Graph highlights:
- **Character Networks**: Who knows whom? Who is related?
- **Spatial Mapping**: How are locations connected?
- **Artifact Ownership**: Where is the "Ancient Key" currently located in your world?

## Graph Intelligence
The graph is more than just a pretty picture:
- **Dynamic Updates**: As you add details to your characters in the Series Bible, the graph updates automatically.
- **AI Synthesis**: Use the graph to ask the AI to identify "influence clusters"—characters who appear most frequently in key arcs.
- **Lore Discovery**: Find "orphaned" entities (lore items you created but never actually used in your manuscript).

## Pro Tip
Use the **Context Lens** to filter the graph by a specific Arc. This will hide everything irrelevant to that specific plot thread, allowing you to focus on the relationships that matter for the scene you are currently writing.
