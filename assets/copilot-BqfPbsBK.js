The Writing Copilot is a context-aware AI assistant integrated directly into your workspace. It doesn't just generate text; it understands your world.

## Key Features

### 1. Context Scoping
You can control exactly what the AI "sees" during a session:
- **Chapter Scope**: Focuses the AI's attention only on the current chapter. Ideal for brainstorming dialogue or describing a specific scene.
- **Novel Scope**: Allows the AI to reference your entire Series Bible and all previous chapters. Use this for global research or cross-checking facts.

### 2. Citations & References
Transparency is key. When the AI answers a question or helps you brainstorm, it provides **Citations**.
- Clicking a citation opens the **Reference Sidebar**.
- You can see exactly which character profile, location, or previous chapter the AI is referencing.

### 3. Context Graph
For Pro users, the **Context Graph** provides a visual map of the AI's "thought process."
- See which Entities and Arcs are currently "active" in the AI's memory.
- Manually pin or unpin lore to fine-tune the AI's creative direction.

## How to Use
1. Open the **Chat Panel** on the right side of the editor.
2. Select your **Scope** (Chapter or Novel) at the bottom.
3. Ask a question or give a command (e.g., *"Summarize the tension between Elias and the Council in Chapter 3"*).
4. Review the citations to ensure consistency with your vision.
